To preview the current mockup, first make sure you have [Tarbell](http://tarbell.tribapps.com/) installed and configured. 
When you are configuring, you don't need to have either Google Spreadsheets or Amazoon S3 setup.


Next, clone this repository and run `tarbell serve` from the project root. You should be able to view the results 
in a browser at `localhost:5000`.
