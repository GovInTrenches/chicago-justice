## Calls for Service

### Summary

In Chicago, all Calls for Service data is controlled by the [http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/oem.html](Office of Emergency Management & Communications) (OEMC). [http://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/oemc/general/img/orgchart.htm](Dispatch operations)-- the reception of 911 calls for service and the dispatch of police to respond to calls-- is managed by OEMC.

The City of Chicago releases no Calls for Service data in bulk format. 

There are many municipalities that publish live or near-live listing of dispatch records for police. There are a number of common elements, including date/time, a unique ID, an address (with a level of specificity going from the block level to the exact address), and a call type. There is often a field for current status or ultimate disposition of the call, including perhaps the source of the call (for instance, whether it was phoned in or if was police-initiated. Often they indicate a geographic area for the call (district, beat, etc.)
