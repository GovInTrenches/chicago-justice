### Data Inventory  

The Illinois Department of Corrections allows you to search by last name, birth date, or inmate number to locate information regarding the status of a single inmate. There is no bulk data that is made available. It is unclear what if any data is collected and what is available through Illinois' Freedom of Information Act. The "Open Data" provided below is available through single inmate search on the [IDOC website](https://www2.illinois.gov/idoc/Offender/Pages/default.aspx).
