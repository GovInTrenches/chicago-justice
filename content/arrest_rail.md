### How to Access Arrest Data in Chicago

To access data from the Chicago Police Department you need to [file a request for data under Illinois' Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cpd/supp_info/cpd_foia.html). You will need to send an email including: **(1)** *your name and contact information*, along with **(2)** *a description of the records you are requesting*. Please try to be reasonably specific for the data you are looking for so that they can more easily process your request.
