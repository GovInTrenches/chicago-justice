## Chicago Police Department (CPD)

#### Summary
Investigating crime can start from two places. First, police officers or from a victim of a crime. After an arrest, police officers and detectives have an important discretion; they can choose whether to file a misdemeanor or felony case with the Cook County Court. 

An incident report is any contact that a police officer has with a resident. Not every incident turns into an arrest. 

The data inventory is a list of the information that's collected by the Chicago Police Department for anyone who's arrested. The inventory is divided into three categories; data that's available through the Freedom of Information request, data readily available and data that is collected but not available.
