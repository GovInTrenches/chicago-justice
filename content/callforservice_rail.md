### How to Access Calls for Service Data in Chicago 

The Chicago Justice Project has successfully requested this dataset from the OEMC for the years 2008-2012. They release it in cleaned spreadsheet format [on their website](http://chicagojustice.org/foi/data-sets-available-for-download/calls-for-police-service).

Currently, the only way to access additional data from the OEMC is to [file a request for data under Illinois' Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/oem/dataset/foialog.html). You will need to send an email including: **(1)** *your name and contact information*, along with **(2)** *a description of the records you are requesting*. Please try to be reasonably specific for the data you are looking for so that they can more easily process your request.

### National Models for Releasing Justice Data

##### Dallas Police Department (Texas)

[The Dallas Police Department](http://www.dallaspolice.net/MediaAccess/Default.aspx) releases calls for police service data in the most robust fashion in the nation.  The data release stands out because it identifies the units responding to each event, a link to map that will display the block from where the call originated, and the status of the call, among other included data fields.  While this is far beyond the level of transparency in Chicago users cannot download the data and certain types of calls for service are not displayed due to privacy concerns.
