## Arrest

### Summary

This is a record of a person being taken into custody and charged with a crime. Typically one of two things happen after an arrest is made: if it is a misdemeanor, the arrest file is prepared for the State's Attorney so that the case can be prosecuted in the Cook County Criminal Court. If it is a felony, the arrest file is prepared for the State's Attorney so that they can review it and decide whether to pursue it as a felony in the Cook County Criminal Court. If no charges are filed by the State's Attorney, there is no further action and no further data. An exception is in the case of a refusal by the State's Attorney to press felony charges. Typically in this instance, the police are then given the opportunity to pursue the case as a misdemeanor.
