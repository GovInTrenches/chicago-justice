### National Models for Releasing Justice Data  

##### King County (Washington)  

[data.kingcounty.gov](https://data.kingcounty.gov/browse?&tags=jail+inmate)  

King County, Washington, is far and away the leader of the pack when it comes to making jail data available and useful. Countless counties throughout the US allow for individuals to go to their website and allow you to search for the status of a single inmate by either name or jail identification number. This seems opt be the standard across the US that the vast majority of jails are striving for. Occasionally included in this limited search is some analysis of the cost to house jail detainees and population analysis over time.  

It is only King County that makes data regarding their inmates available in machine ready format that allows you to either visual the data online or download it in your preferred format. The portal works exactly like the City of Chicago data portal. It is not the easiest to use to find data about a single inmate but it is far superior to any other county's site in making large amount of data about their detainees available for analysis.
