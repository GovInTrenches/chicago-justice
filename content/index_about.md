## About the Project

All over Chicago, every day, in every corner of our oblong city, people commit crimes. This project seeks to index the data that documents these crimes and what if any response there is from the local criminal justice system. We cover the collection of the voice of victims when they call 911, the daily notes of detectives who investigate crime, the material delivered to the court system when charges are filed, the records generated when those who are convicted arrive in prison, and so on.

The documentation is immense. Some is published. Much of it is not. Our goal is to create a flat simple guide to what is known and what is not. This documentation process begins with a crime and ends with a disposition of a case. The disposition could be a crime that goes unsolved, without charges, or ends in a conviction.
