### About the Data

The three categories (open, FOIA, and unavailable) specify three distinct means of obtaining relevant data. *Open* describes data fields that are made readily available to the public via electronic means. Anyone can view this data easily online and it doesn't need to be requested.

Every record or data that's collected by the government, with few exceptions, should be available to the public under Illinois' Freedom of Information Act. Any category labeled "FOIA" refers to the data that was made available under this law.

Unavailable data is never made available to anyone outside the office in question. Usually these items are withheld to protect individuals such as victims and those who call the police, but there are some offices that are exempt from FOIA and thus release no data.
