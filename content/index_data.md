## About the Data
<hr>
The three categories (open, FOIA, and unavailable) specify three distinct means of obtaining relevant data. Open data describes sets that are made readily available to the public. Anyone can view this data easily online without formally requesting it.

Every record or data collected by the government, with few exceptions, should be available to the public under Illinois' Freedom of Information Act. Any category labeled "FOIA" refers to the data that was made available under this law. Specific information about obtaining FOIA data from the various agencies is on each page.

Unavailable data is never made available to anyone. Usually these items are withheld to protect personal or compromising information about individuals such as victims and those who call the police, but there are some offices that are exempt from FOIA and thus release no data.
