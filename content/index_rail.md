#### Data Availability Chart

The chart below aims to paint a broad picture of how much data is available within each agency of Chicago's criminal justice system and compare them. On each page, the relevant row will be highlighted.

The three categories (open, FOIA, and unavailable) specify three distinct means of obtaining relevant data. The size of the circles represents the amount of data in each category; an empty cell means that no information can be obtained by that means.
