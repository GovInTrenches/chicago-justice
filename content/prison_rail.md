### How to Access the Data

To access data from the Illinois Department of Corrections, you need to [file a request for data under Illinois' Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)](https://www2.illinois.gov/idoc/Pages/FreedomofInformationAct.aspx). You will need to send an email including: **(1)** *your name and contact information*, along with **(2)** *a description of the records you are requesting*. Please try to be reasonably specific for the data you are looking for so that they can more easily process your request.
