### About this Project

The <b>Crime and Punishment in Chicago</b> project, provides an index of data sources regarding the criminal justice system in Chicago. We track data sources from the first 911 call all the way to court or jail. We aggregate sources of data, provide insight into how this data is generated, discuss how to get it, and expose what data is unavailable. This project intends to use practices of data journalism to uncover the value of data and to discover the stories behind it. We used the Chicago Tribune's <a href="http://tarbell.tribapps.com/">Tarbell</a> content management system to build our site.
