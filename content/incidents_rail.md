### How to Access Crime Incident Data in Chicago

Some but not all Crime Incident data is available through the [City of Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2).

To access greater or more specific data from the Chicago Police Department, you need to [file a request for data under Illinois' Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cpd/supp_info/cpd_foia.html). You will need to send an email including: **(1)** *your name and contact information*, along with **(2)** *a description of the records you are requesting*. Please try to be reasonably specific for the data you are looking for so that they can more easily process your request.

### National Models for Releasing Justice Data

##### City of Chicago (Illinois)  

[The City of Chicago's data portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2) provides excellent access to crime incident data that is either usable online or can be downloaded for later use. While the portal leads other cities in usability the Chicago Police Department only makes available crime incident data. [Henrico County](http://randolph.co.henrico.va.us/public-data-access/searcharrest.aspx), Virginia, makes arrest data available. This is the only source we have located that makes this data available online; however, while this data is searchable online you cannot download the data in bulk.
