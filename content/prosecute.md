### Summary

This office prosecutes crimes. Prosecutors work closely with the investigating agency, which includes Chicago Police, Cook County Sheriff's office among others. The lawyers take the case to determine what charges to file and whether there is enough evidence to prosecute the case, this is part of the Felony Review Unit. This unit alone has the authority to approve homicide charges; or, in cases involving juveniles, homicide charges or any lesser charge arising from the same occurrence (Not including drug or syndicated gambling charges).  

### Data Inventory 

The data inventory is a list of the information that's recorded by the State's Attorney's Office for all the cases that they prosecute. Conceptually, there are three possibilities for this data:
<ol>
  <li>Data readily available,</li>
  <li>Data available through a Freedom of Information (FOI) request, and</li>
  <li>Data that is collected but not available.</li>
</ol>
<br>

#### Open Data

Currently, there is no information publicly available or online from the Prosecutor's Office about the data they collect. It is known that some information trail exists, although it may be that much of it is never entered into a database.

#### FOIA Accessible Data

#### Unavailable Data

All of the data this agency may collect is unavailable.
