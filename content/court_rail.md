In Illinois, and on the federal level, the courts are exempted from having to abide by the Freedom of Information Act. Court records are deemed to be open for public inspection and can be viewed during normal working hours by going to the appropriate Circuit Court to view them.  The Cook County Clerk of the Circuit Court maintains both the court paper records and the electronic data the courts generate.  To obtain access to electronic court data you have to file a request for such data with the Chief Judge's office.  If your request is approved it is then sent to the Circuit Court Clerk's office and they will provide you the data.

The Maryland Courts website allows access to the most robust amount of data of any court we located. It lists what occurs in every court hearing while also detailing information regarding the officer that arrested the defendant, the prosecutor(s) prosecuting the case, and the judge presiding over the case. This site also details information regarding the defendant's lawyer. Not a single court would allow the bulk downloading of data involved in the cases.
