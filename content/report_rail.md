### National Models for Releasing Justice Data  

##### Dallas Police Department (Texas)
>[www.dallaspolice.net](http://www.dallaspolice.net/MediaAccess/Default.aspx) > The Dallas Police Department releases calls for police service data in the most robust fashion in the nation.  The data release stands out because it identifies the units responding to each event, a link to map that will display the block from where the call originated, and the status of the call, among other included data fields.  While this is far beyond the level of transparency in Chicago users cannot download the data and certain types of calls for service are not displayed due to privacy concerns.
