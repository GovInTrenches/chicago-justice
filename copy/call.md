## Data

#### Availability

Although it is known that data-collection happens for this entry point to Chicago's criminal justice system, neither anonymized nor agreggate data is publicly available on an up-to-date basis; rather, it must be requested through the [FOIA](http://www.foia.gov/about.html). 

[The Chicago Justice Project](http://www.chicagojustice.org/about/us) (CJP) did submit a FOIA request for data on calls for police service. You can find the result of that request [here](http://www.chicagojustice.org/foi/data-sets-available-for-download/calls-for-police-service), for the years 2008-2011. 

#### Format

The data we have is aggregated, meaning that there are no individual records of calls, nor any specific addresses that can be linked to specific incidents. It is broken down by the 25 police districts, by event type that the operator judged the call to represent (of which there are about 300), as well as sometimes by day of the week (for 2008-2010).

#### Summary

For the year of 2011, there were 6,595,636 total calls received. . . .

#### Uses

From this data, you can extract information about the areas with the highest and/or lowest calls for service, as well as what types of calls come from which areas.

## Limitations 

- Because of the aggregated nature of the data received by way of FOIA request it is not possible to follow up on a specific call by tying it to incident reports of police, or court cases, or jail sentences. 

- The whole picture is similarly atomized in that the event types recorded reflect only the judgment of 911 operators, and may differ from later stages of classification, like police crime reports, so that even aggregate correlations between different datasets can't necessarily be trusted.
