# Call for Service

There are two potential starting points for an individual's contact with the law. The first and most common is that a call for service goes out to a 911 operator, after which they are dispatched to police officer.

Although it is known that data-collection happens for this stage of the criminal justice system, neither anonymized nor agreggate data is publicly available; rather, it must be requested through the [FOIA](http://www.foia.gov/about.html).

As a result of the lack of data, it is not clear what percent of these calls result in a report being filed, or even a police response.
