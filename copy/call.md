# Call for Service

#### Basics

There are two potential starting points for an individual's contact with the law. The first is that a call for service goes out to a 911 operator at the [Office of Emergency Management and Communications](https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/oem.html) (OEMC), after which it is dispatched to a police officer. 

#### Data Availability

Although it is known that data-collection happens for this entry point to Chicago's criminal justice system, neither anonymized nor agreggate data is publicly available on an up-to-date basis; rather, it must be requested through the [FOIA](http://www.foia.gov/about.html). 

[The Chicago Justice Project](http://www.chicagojustice.org/about/us) (CJP) did submit a FOIA request for data on calls for police service. You can find the result of that request [here](http://www.chicagojustice.org/foi/data-sets-available-for-download/calls-for-police-service), for the years 2008-2011. It is aggreggated data, meaning that there are no individual records of calls that can be linked to specific incidents, nor any specific addresses. The data is broken down by police district (of which there are 25), event type (of which there are about 300), as well as sometimes by day of the week (for 2008-2010). For the year 2011, there were 6595636 total calls received. 


#### Other Municipalities

Some municipalities keep up-to-date call for service data, for example [Seattle's](http://www2.seattle.gov/fire/realTime911/getRecsForDatePub.asp?action=Today&incDate=&rad1=des) Fire Department, or [Milwaukee's](http://itmdapps.milwaukee.gov/MPDCallData/currentCADCalls/callsService.faces) Police Department. Both of these are updated within hours of real-time, and both have individual locations tied to incidents.

#### Limitations

As a result of the lack of public data, it is not clear how many of these calls result in a report being filed, or even a police response. Nor is it possible, because of the aggregated nature of the data received by way of FOIA request, to follow up on a specific call by tying it to incident reports of police, or court cases, or jail sentences.
