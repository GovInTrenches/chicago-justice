# State's Attorney's Office

However, police cannot charge felonies in Cook County. Almost every single felony charge must go through Felony Review, a construct unique to Cook County and Rockford. It is a method that appears to let the Cook County State's Attorney "try" a case before a judge is even involved, thereby leading to a supposedly higher conviction rate. Eighty percent of misdemeanor cases that have been dismissed since 2006 were thrown out by the Cook County State's Attorney's Office or city attorneys--not by a trial or a judge. Roughly half were dismissed without a stated reason.

We pretty much have no idea what goes on there and how the decisions are made regarding which cases will be dropped or moved forward. This office has a large amount of discretion in terms of processing and reviewing felony cases. This is significant because the department must determine several factors when they decide to either:

1) treat it as a felony, or  
2) downgrade the charge to a misdemeanor.  

The States Attorney's Felony Review Unit alone has the authority to approve homicide charges; or, in cases involving juveniles, homicide charges or any lesser charge arising from the same occurrence.
