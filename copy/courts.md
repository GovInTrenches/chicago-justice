# Courts

The court system consists of four major steps: a bond hearing, a discovery hearing, a trial by either judge or jury, and a sentencing hearing. While the suspect is going through the court process, the ones who are not able to make bail remain in jail, where, as stated previously, the chances of them getting yet another charge added to their record likely.

## Bond Hearing

Under Illinois law (725 ILCS 5/110 1-18), every person who is arrested for a felony has the right to have a bond hearing before a Bond Court. For misdemeanor cases, bond is unusually posted at the police station and a bond hearing doesn't takes place.

At a felony bond hearing, the only issue that is decided by the Court is how much money the accused will have to post in order to be released from jail while the case is pending. This is a very important phase of the criminal process because if the judge sets a high bond, the accused may be forced to spend months in county jail until the case finishes. Further, the Court can refuse to set a bond if the judge believes the accused poses a danger to society. It is critical for the accused to be represented by an attorney that is skilled and experienced in handling bond hearings. At Bond Court, the accused has his first opportunity to tell the Court positive things about himself, his family, and work history.

## Discovery Hearing

Discovery, in the law of the United States, is the pre-trial phase in a lawsuit in which each party, through the law of civil procedure, can obtain evidence from the opposing party by means of discovery devices including requests for answers to interrogatories, requests for production of documents, requests for admissions and depositions. Discovery can be obtained from non-parties using subpoenas. When discovery requests are objected to, the requesting party may seek the assistance of the court by filing a motion to compel discovery.

## Trial (Judge or Jury)

A criminal trial is designed to resolve accusations brought (usually by a government) against a person accused of a crime. In common law systems, most criminal defendants are entitled to a trial held before a jury. Because the state is attempting to use its power to deprive the accused of life, liberty, or property, the rights of the accused afforded to criminal defendants are typically broad. The rules of criminal procedure provide rules for criminal trials.

## Sentencing Hearing

A sentencing hearing is where the final sentence or penalty is determined. The law gives the judge a great deal of leeway in determining what the sentence may be. The character of and circumstances surrounding the defendant can be as important as the severity of the crime in determining what sentence will be imposed.

The sentence is imposed after the jury or judge has provided the judgment. At the sentencing hearing, both the prosecution and the defense are given the opportunity to present evidence and testimony to recommend an appropriate sentence. The judge is free to ignore these recommendations, even if the prosecutor and defense lawyer have agreed to a sentence as a part of a plea agreement.
