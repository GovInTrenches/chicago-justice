Cases can also be initiated by the police. Most arrests made by police are not in response to any sort of complaint; they happen when officers see a suspicious individual and detain them for a minor crime to prevent them from committing a major one. This tactic has been compared to New York City's "stop and frisk" policy, which was recently declared an unconstitutional guise of racial profiling. While this practice may reduce immediate crime, it seems to be a contributing factor in polluting Chicago's criminal justice system.

At this node in the system, the department has two types of discretion points.

1. whether or not the officer will actually write up an incident report and pursue the crime or if the suspect will walk free. Here, the police have fairly unlimited discretion in deciding how long an inmate will remain in jail based upon their summary of the events.  
2. whether the detectives will decide to pursue investigation of a call or incident claim.  

The police also must decide whether to make the case a felony or a misdemeanor, which will result in either its being processed by the State's Attorneys Office or the case being sent directly to a judge.
