		<p>There are two potential starting points for crime. The City of Chicago Data Portal provides some data regarding 9-1-1 calls made to police but there is no way of knowing which of these calls will result in a report being filed or even whether they are responded to in x% of cases.</p>
		<p>An obvious point of discretion at this stage is whether or not an officer responds to a 9-1-1 call in the first place.</p>
		<p>The data about this stage of the system is not publicly available, and must be requested through the FOIA.</p>
